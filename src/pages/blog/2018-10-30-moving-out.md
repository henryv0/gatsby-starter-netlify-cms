I moved out of the nest for the first time this year. My partner and I have both lived at home all our lives! And this was the next big step.

It's been exhilarating! I'm honestly surprised by how much I've enjoyed spotting deals on gumtree and rifling through unwanted possessions on the street. It must be the bargain hunter in me... -closes OzBargain tab-. It's been a mad rush to fill our apartment, to change it from a white, sterile hotel-like apartment into something warmer, something I can call home. In the past two months, we've bought everything from a couch (which barely fit into the lift, even when dismantled) to a giant yellow lamp.

But that's the fun stuff out of the way. Now it's about getting into a routine. The minutiae of it all. That'll be the real challenge, won't it?
